# Libft Introduction

## :sparkles: What Is This?
**Libft (Library Of Functions)** is a fun project I worked on at 42KL, where I created basic C functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `strcmp`, and put them into a library.

## :computer: How It's Made

**Tech:** C, Makefile, Shell, gcc

I made Libft using C language. I wrote functions for things like working with words and managing memory. I organized these functions into groups to make them easier to understand.

## :rocket: Running the Project

To compile the library, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the Libft directory with `cd path/to/libft`.
3. Run `make` to compile the library into a `libft.a` file.

## :wrench: Using the Library

To use Libft in your projects, include the `libft.h` header file in your source files. When compiling, add `-lft -Lpath/to/libft.a` flags to link the library.

```markdown
gcc your_file.c -lft -Lpath/to/libft.a -Ipath/to/libft.h
```

## :books: Lesson Learned
Making Libft taught me important things:

1. **C Programming:** I learned more about C, including pointers, memory, and using header files.
   
2. **Memory Management:** I learned how to manage memory efficiently, which is important in C programming.

3. **Makefile:** I learned to use Makefiles to build my project automatically, which saved time.

4. **Good Coding Practices:** I learned to write clearer code by organizing it better and adding comments.
